** Emacs in server mode

  Run emacs in server mode, to file 
 
  #+begin_src sh
    /usr/bin/emacs --daemon &
  #+end_src

  For editing something just make shortcuts belove. 
   
  #+begin_src sh
    /usr/bin/emacsclient -c -a "emacs" "some.txt"
  #+end_src
 
  Also convince to create some alias to that comment in ~.bashrc~, ~.xprofile~ ... somewhere in script which invoked when system start. 
 
  #+begin_src sh
    alias emdit="emacsclient -c -a emacs"
  #+end_src

  If you want to use emacsclient to open some files in =nautilus= or make client mode of emacs as desktop icon, you need to create in path ~/usr/share/applications/~ or =~/.local/share/applications/= file with name [[https://github.com/SerhiiRI/config-files/blob/master/emacs/emacsclient.desktop][emacsclient.desktop]], which being visible from GTK toolkits
